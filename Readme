# NSK Analytical Dashboard - Portfolio Project

## Overview
This project simulates an end-to-end data solution for NSK, a Japanese multinational leader in bearing manufacturing. Designed to demonstrate ETL, data modeling, and visualization skills, the dashboard delivers strategic insights into global operations.

## Project Architecture

### üß© Synthetic Data Generation
- Python scripts for realistic datasets:
  - 100 globally distributed customers
  - 50 categorized products (Automotive/Industrial)
  - 10 production plants in 10 countries
  - 1,000 sales records
  - 180 quality control entries

### üóÉÔ∏è Database Modeling
- Optimized star schema:
  ```mermaid
  erDiagram
      SALES ||--o{ PRODUCTS : "contains"
      PRODUCTS }o--|| PLANTS : "produced_at"
      SALES ||--o{ CUSTOMERS : "performed_by"
      QUALITY }o--|| PLANTS : "monitored_at"

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, OS, graphviz)
- graphviz (for visualizing data flows)
- SQL (T-SQL for SQL Server)
- Power BI (DAX for calculations)
- Mermaid (ER diagrams)
- SQL Server (for database management)
- Power BI (for data visualization)
- Git (version control)

## How to Run
In the root directory, you will find the following folders and files:

  - **dataset**: Contains scripts to generate synthetic data and insert it into the database.
  - **DDL**: Contains SQL scripts for database setup and data insertion.
  - **powerbi**: Contains the Power BI dashboard file.
In DDL:
For the database setup, we have the following files:
A PNG with the ER diagram of the database, which shows the relationships between the tables.
we have the file "ms_sql_ddl_er.sql" which contains the DDL for the database, including the creation of tables and relationships.
Also i've created a mwb file for MySQL Workbench, which can be used to visualize the database schema and relationships.

In dataset:
  Generate datasets: dataset.py
  after this, you can run the following scripts to insert data into the database:
    insert_qualidade.ipynb
    insert_vendas.ipynb
    insert_produtos.ipynb
    insert_clientes.ipynb
    insert_plantas.ipynb
  All of these scripts will insert data directly into the database. But they have the option to create a .sql file with the insert statements.


Import to Power BI: NSK_Dashboard.pbix

## In addition to the Power BI dashboard, i have explore some SQL queries that answer management-related questions.
## These queries are located in the "SQL Queries" folder and can be used to extract insights from the database.
